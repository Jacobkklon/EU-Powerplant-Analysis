# EU-Powerplant-Analysis

In this project I performed exploratory analysis on a dataset describing EU Powerplants, their size, and energy sources. I manipulated and grouped the data with Pandas to visualize the current energy production of EU by energy source and capacity. I also then showcased how the capacity is distributed amongst European countries. 

The goal of this project was to leverage the data in order to provide insight in terms of EU electric policy, so these visuals would allow decision-makers insight into where the EU can improve and how different countries vary in terms of their electricity generation.
